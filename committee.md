### General Chair

**[Alvitta Ottley](http://visualdata.wustl.edu)**

Alvitta Ottley is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. She also holds a courtesy appointment in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. Her research uses interdisciplinary approaches to solve problems such as how best to display information for effective decision-making and how we can design human-in-the-loop visual analytics interfaces that are more attuned to the way people think.


### Paper Chairs

**[Anamaria Crisan](https://amcrisan.github.io/)**

Dr. Anamaria Crisan is a Lead Research Scientist at Tableau.  She conducts interdisciplinary research that integrates techniques and methods from machine learning, human computer interaction, and data visualization. Her research focuses on the intersection of Data Science and Data Visualization, especially toward the way humans can collaboratively work together with ML/AI systems through visual interfaces.

**[Michael Behrisch]( https://mbehrisch.github.io/)**

Michael Behrisch is a Tenured Assistant Professor for Visual Analytics (UD1) in the Visualization and Graphics Group at the Utrecht University, Department of Information and Computing Sciences. His research focuses on novel visual interactive techniques, algorithmic approaches, and integrated visual analytics systems to support users in navigating and exploring large amounts of relational data.

### Web/Tech Chair

**[Jorge Piazentin Ono](https://vgc.poly.edu/~jhenrique/)** 

Jorge Piazentin Ono is a Research Scientist at Bosch Research. His research lies at the intersection of Visual Analytics, Explainable Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interfaces, with a focus on interactive systems for data and model analysis. He holds a Ph.D. degree from New York University.

### Publicity Chairs

**[Shayan Monadjemi](https://smonadjemi.github.io/)**

Shayan Monadjemi is a Ph.D. candidate in the Visual Data Analysis Group at Washington University in St. Louis and a Pathways intern in the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA Ames Research Center. His research investigates visual analytic systems which learn from user interactions and assist users in making sense of data.

### Steering Committee

**[Torsten Möller](https://cs.univie.ac.at/Torsten.Möller)**  
 
 Torsten Möller is a professor of computer science at the University of Vienna, Austria where he heads the research platform [Data Science @ Uni Vienna](http://datascience.univie.ac.at) as well as the research group on [Visualization and Data Analysis](http://vda.cs.univie.ac.at). Since 2018, he serves as the editor-in-chief for IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications.

**[Adam Perer](http://perer.org/)**  
 
Adam Perer is an Assistant Research Professor at Carnegie Mellon University, where he is a member of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute. His research integrates data visualization and machine learning techniques to create visual interactive systems to help users make sense out of big data. Lately, his research focuses on human-centered data science and extracting insights from clinical data to support data-driven medicine. This work has been published at premier venues in visualization, human-computer interaction, and medical informatics. He was previously a Research Scientist at IBM Research. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, College Park.
